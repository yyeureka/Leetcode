/*
Given an list interval, which are taking off and landing time of the flight. How many airplanes are there at most at the same time in the sky?
Notes:
If landing and taking off of different planes happen at the same time, we consider landing should happen at first.

Example 1:
Input: [(1, 10), (2, 3), (5, 8), (4, 7)]
Output: 3
Explanation:
The first airplane takes off at 1 and lands at 10.
The second ariplane takes off at 2 and lands at 3.
The third ariplane takes off at 5 and lands at 8.
The forth ariplane takes off at 4 and lands at 7.
During 5 to 6, there are three airplanes in the sky.
Example 2:
Input: [(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)]
Output: 1
Explanation: Landing happen before taking off.
